## Requirments

For environment setup, please follow the [MFM installation](https://github.com/Jiahao000/MFM/blob/master/docs/INSTALL.md).

## Dataset

### Training Data Preparation

We use  **DM** for training:
- 48 genuine document images
- 386 screen-recaptured images

You can download the dataset [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1cSHTpfrWxP8nUyHTRZOZ_g).  ðŸ”‘Extraction code: `rtw1`

**Preprocessing Steps**:
1. Crop images into 224Ã—224 patches.
2. Apply data-level oversampling:
   - Duplicate genuine samples
   - Maintain class balance
3. Please organise the training set as follows (0-legal; 1-recaptured):
```plaintext
DM/
â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 0/         
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ HUAWEIP9_0009_1.tif
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1/   
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ IMG_20230521_231421_0_0.tif
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### Testing Data Preparation

We use **SRDID162** for testing. You can download the dataset [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1M2GYhMPQHe6af_gvGT1Z1w).   ðŸ”‘Extraction code: `89kx`

## Frequency-domain MoirÃ© AuGmentation (FMAG)
The FMAG is implemented in `FMAG.py` and run `python FMAG.py`.

## DPAD Network Trained by FMAG

### Training

1. Modify the data path, backbone type, and training parameters in `configs/config1.py`.
2. run `python main_backbone.py train`.

### Testing 
run `python main_backbone.py test`.

## Masked MoirÃ© Frequency Modeling (MÂ²FM).

1. Modify the `CSV_TRAIN_PATH`, `MODEL_FAG`, `MODEL_NAME` in `config.py`.
2. Please organise the training set as follows:
3. Run the training command.
```
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4 main_mfm_FAG.py
--cfg configs/vit_base/mfm_pretrain__vit_base__img224__300ep.yaml
--launcher="pytorch" --batch-size 36 --output ./output --tag experiment name
```
